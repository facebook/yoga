# Align Items

Align items describes how to align children along the cross axis of their container.
Align items is very similar to [justify content](/docs/styling/justify-content) but instead of
applying to the main axis, align items applies to the cross axis.

**Stretch (default)**: Stretch children of a container to match the [height](/docs/styling/width-height) of the container's cross axis.

**Flex start**: Align children of a container to the start of the container's cross axis.

**Flex end**: Align children of a container to the end of the container's cross axis.

**Center**: Align children of a container in the center of the container's cross axis.

**Baseline**: Align children of a container along a common baseline. Individual children can be set to be the reference baseline for their parents.

# Align Self

Align self has the same options and effect as align items but instead of
affecting the children within a container, you can apply this property to
a single child to change its alignment within its parent. Align self
overrides any option set by the parent with align items.
