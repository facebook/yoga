# baseurl determines the subpath of your site. For example if you're using an
# organisation.github.io/reponame/ basic site URL, then baseurl would be set
# as "/reponame" but leave blank if you have a top-level domain URL as it is
# now set to "" by default as discussed in:
# http://jekyllrb.com/news/2016/10/06/jekyll-3-3-is-here/
baseurl: "/yoga"

# the base hostname & protocol for your site
# If baseurl is set, then the absolute url for your site would be url/baseurl
# This was also be set to the right thing automatically for local development

# Note: There are new filters in Jekyll 3.3 to help with absolute and relative urls
# absolute_url
# relative_url
# So you will see these used throughout the Jekyll code in this template.
# no more need for | prepend: site.url | prepend: site.baseurl

# Blog posts are built into Jekyll by default, with the `_posts` directory.
# Here you can specify other types of documentation. The names here are `docs`
# and `top-level`. This means their content will be in `_docs` and `_top-level`.
# The permalink format is also given.
