# About Yoga

Yoga is an embeddable layout system used in popular UI frameworks like React Native. Yoga itself is not a UI framework, and does not do any drawing itself. Yoga's only responsibility is determining the size and position of boxes.

Yoga supports a familiar subset of CSS, mostly focused on Flexbox. This gives users a familiar model, and enables sharing code between native platforms and the browser.

Yoga is written in C++, with a public C API. This allows Yoga to be used by a wide variety of languages, via both official and unofficial bindings.
