For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n\t * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n\t *\n\t *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n\t *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n\t *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n\t *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n\t *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n\t *\n\t * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n\t * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n\t *\n\t * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n\t * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t *\n\t * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n\t * if it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n\t * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n\t *\n\t *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n\t *\n\t * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n\t * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n\t * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n\t *\n\t * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n\t * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n\t * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n\t * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n\t *\n\t *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n\t *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n\t *     }\n\t *\n\t * All Immutable collections are Value Objects: they implement `equals()`\n\t * and `hashCode()`.\n\t */\n\tfunction is(valueA, valueB) {\n\t  if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t    return true;\n\t  }\n\t  if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t    return false;\n\t  }\n\t  if (\n\t    typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n\t    typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function'\n\t  ) {\n\t    valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n\t    valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n\t    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t      return false;\n\t    }\n\t  }\n\t  return !!(\n\t    isValueObject(valueA) &&\n\t    isValueObject(valueB) &&\n\t    valueA.equals(valueB)\n\t  );\n\t}\n\t\n\tvar imul =\n\t  typeof Math.imul === 'function' && Math.imul(0xffffffff, 2) === -2\n\t    ?

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n *\n *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n *\n * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n *\n * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n *\n * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n * if it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n *\n *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n *\n * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n *\n * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n *\n *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n *     }\n *\n * All Immutable collections are Value Objects: they implement `equals()`\n * and `hashCode()`.\n */\nfunction is(valueA, valueB) {\n  if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n    return true;\n  }\n  if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  if (\n    typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n    typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function'\n  ) {\n    valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n    valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n  return !!(\n    isValueObject(valueA) &&\n    isValueObject(valueB) &&\n    valueA.equals(valueB)\n  );\n}\n\nvar imul =\n  typeof Math.imul === 'function' && Math.imul(0xffffffff, 2) === -2\n    ?
