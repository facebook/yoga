Setting the flex basis of a child is similar to setting the <code>width</code> of that\nchild if its parent is a container with <code>flex direction: row</code> or setting the <code>height</code> of a child\nif its parent is a container with <code>flex direction: column</code>. The flex basis of an item is the\ndefault size of that item, the size of the item before any flex grow and flex shrink\ncalculations are performed.</p>\n<p><controls prop="flexBasis"></controls></p>'}}}});
